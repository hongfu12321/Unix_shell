# 42sh
42sh is a 4-5 person team recreation of the bash shell in the C language. It has all the normal components of your typical shell: command execution, environment variables, path management, memory management, C-Unix command execution, abstract syntax trees for command parsing etc. However, it also requires more advanced features such as input/output redirections, file description and job control, subshells, globbing, command history, dynamic auto-completion, and even the option to recode a script execution system. This project requires a high proficiency with memory management, code organization, and performance optimization.
